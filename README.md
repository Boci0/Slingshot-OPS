## Overview

**Slingshot OPS** is an action-strategy roguelike game where precision launching meets tactical node-based map traversal. Slingshot your operative ball at hostile units, utilize dynamic wall-bounces and overcharged abilities, acquire game-changing relics, and permanently upgrade your stats across runs.

## Key Features

- **Branching Tactical Node Map**: Procedurally generated 5-floor campaign with Combat, Elite, Boss, Encounter, Shop, Rest, and Minigame nodes.
- **40+ Collectibles & Relics**: Build synergies across 8 unique categories (*Tactical*, *Gladiator*, *High-Tech*, *Frontier*, *Sanctuary*, etc.).
- **Persistent Tech Tree**: Earn Tech Points to unlock permanent upgrades across Sharpshooter (ATK), Vitality (HP), and Aegis (DEF).
